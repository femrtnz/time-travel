## Time Travel - A space-time travel machine


- personal galactic identifier (PGI) (alphanumeric, always starts with a letter, between
5-10 characters)
- place
- date

#### For a journey to be successful you need to make sure the same person (identified by the PGI) cannot travel to the same place and date twice. You don't want to create a paradox by someone meeting themselves!
